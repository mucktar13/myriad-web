              When buying a Myriad Token, you understand that it has a monetary
              value that can be fluctuated. Therefore, if you wish to exchange

              the currency exchange settlements will be subject to the rate at
              the point of exchange. You are also able to convert other
              cryptocurrencies that you own into a Myriad Token. You understand
              and agree that the exchange rate will also be subject to the rate
              at the point when you are making an exchange.

              If you wish to make changes to your purchase, please contact us.
              We will let you know if this change is possible. Please note that
              changes may impact price as well as other aspects of your
              purchase. If you purchase Myriad Token, you acknowledge and agree
              that we start supplying the Myriad Token to you as soon as the
              purchase is complete and therefore, your right to cancel or
